# Class in python

## Object-oriented programming in Python
In non-object-oriented programming, the function to treat some data is independent from the data structure. For example, the multiplication of scalar, vector, and matrix is all different procedures.
* Therefore you have to write functions for each; `multiply_scaler`, `multiply_vector`, and `multiply_matrix`, for example.
* In object-oriented programming, the function to treat the data (object) is defined with the data itself; *object is first, and its function should belong to it*.
Usually, objected-oriented programming has some merits, for example, it is easier to read, and more robust to error (wrong coding).

## Class
* Class is a template for an object. You need to define *data structure* and functions. 
* Data structure or variables belonging to a class is called *attribute*. Functions are usually called *methods*.
* If you define a class and make some object in the main routine, it is called *instantiation*.

## Defining a class in Python
### Basics
```python
class SimpleData:
    a = 0
    b = 0

    def sum(self):
        c = self.a + self.b
        return c
  
    def set(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
```
* Class needs *at least one argument*, so `self` is used for this purpose. It specifies the instance itself, and *should be always included*.
* `sum` and `set` are methods belonging to `SimpleData`.
* In `set`, *instance variables* a and b are set.

* You can call the above class in the main routine, as
```python
data1 = SimpleData()

data1.set(1, 2)
print(data1.sum())
```
* You can access the variables belonging to the object by `.` (dot). This is called an *instance variable*.
```python
a1 = SimpleData.a
b1 = SimpleData.b
```

### special methods
1. `__init__`
* This is called *constructor*, which is the special method called when the class is instantiated. It should be written like
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.a = 0
    self.b = 0
```

2. `__call__`
* This is called when the instance is called like a function.
```python {cmd}
class Hello:
    def __init__(self):
        print("init is called")

    def __call__(self):
        print("call is called")

hello = Hello()
hello()
```

## super
* Now consider making a class for a soccer player and a baseball player.
```python {cmd}
class SoccerPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def self_introduce(self):
        print(f"I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old.")

    def kick(self):
        print("Kick!")

class BaseballPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def self_introduce(self):
        print(f"I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old.")

    def catch(self):
        print("Catch!")
```
* The `self_introduce` method is common to two classes, so we would like to omit to write it twice.
* To do this, let's define `Person` class, and consider `SoccerPlayer` and `BaseballPlayer` inherit the nature of `Person` class. This is called **inheritance**.
```python{cmd}
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def self_introduce(self):
        print(f"I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old.")

# put Person as the argument of the class definition
class SoccerPlayer(Person):
    def kick(self):
        print("Kick!")

class BaseballPlayer(Person):
    def catch(self):
        print("Catch!")

s1 = SoccerPlayer("Messi", 36)
b1 = BaseballPlayer("Okada", 66)

# Now SoccerPlayer and BaseballPlayer classes can use 
# self_introduce, because they inherit the Person class.
s1.self_introduce()
b1.self_introduce()
```
* You can add some attributes specialized to the child class by calling `super().__init__()` in `__init__`.
```python{cmd}
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def self_introduce(self):
        print(f"I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old.")

class SoccerPlayer(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, is_striker):
        # call __init__ of the base class
        super().__init__(name, age)
        # is_striker attribute is only for SoccerPlayer
        self.is_striker = is_striker

    def self_introduce(self):
        super().self_introduce()
        print("I'm a soccer player.")

        if self.is_striker:
            print("I'm a striker.")

    def kick(self):
        print("Kick!")

s1 = SoccerPlayer("Messi", 36, True)

s1.self_introduce()
```

## Exercise:
* Create a Car class with the following specifications:

1. Attributes:
* make: Make of the car (string)
* model: Model of the car (string)
* year: Year the car was manufactured (integer)

2. Methods:
* `__init__`: Constructor method to initialize the attributes.
* display_info: Method that prints out the make, model, and year of the car.
* Create an instance of the Car class, set some values for its attributes, and display its information.
