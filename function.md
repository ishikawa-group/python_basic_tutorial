# Function
* In this lecture, we learn how to define and use functions in Python.
* A **function** summarizes several instructions (or commands) into one.
* First you **define** a function, then you **call** it to use.

* Let's try to calculate the average score of Math, English, and Science for students A and B.
```python
stu_A_score = {"Math": 89, "English": 30, "Science": 86}
stu_B_score = {"Math": 59, "English": 70, "Science": 65}

aveA = (stu_A_score["Math"] + stu_A_score["English"] + stu_A_score["Science"])/3
aveB = (stu_B_score["Math"] + stu_B_score["English"] + stu_B_score["Science"])/3

print(f"Average of A is {aveA:.2f}, B is {aveB:.2f}")
```
* Clearly, taking average is common procedure so you do not want to write it twice.
```python
def average(scores):
    sum = 0
    for key, val in scores.items():
        sum += val
    ave = sum/len(scores)
    return ave

stu_A_score = {"Math": 89, "English": 30, "Science": 86}
stu_B_score = {"Math": 59, "English": 70, "Science": 65}

aveA = average(stu_A_score)
aveB = average(stu_B_score)

print(f"Average of A is {aveA:.2f}, B is {aveB:.2f}")
```

## Basic
* You can define a function like
```python
def say_hello():
    return "hello"
```
* A function will `return` the result when it is called, and returned value will be stored to other variable.
```python
def say_hello():
    return "hello"

s = say_hello()
print(s)
```

* The `return` statement is not mandatory, so you can omit it like
```python
def say_hello2():
    print("hello")

say_hello2()
```
* But I recommend writing return for safety. If no need to return, you can put `None`.
```python
def say_hello3():
    print("hello")
    return None

say_hello3()
```
## Exercise
* Define and call the function that repeats the string you inputted ("abc" -> "abcabc")

## Argument
* **argument** is the variable that one passes to the function. The function usually does some procedure using that argument. You can pass an argument to the function, like
```python
def say_something(s):
    print(s)
    return None

say_something("hello")
```
* You can set the default value for arguments like
```python
def say_something(s="hello"):
    print(s)
    return s

say_something("good morning")
say_something()
```
* You can use multiple arguments
```python
def combine_string(s1, s2):
    new_string = s1 + " " + s2
    return new_string

s = combine_string("Good", "Morning")
print(s)
```
* You can also use multiple return-value, as
```python
def say_strong(s1, s2):
    s1new = s1 + "!"
    s2new = s2 + "!"
    return s1new, s2new

s1new, s2new = say_strong("Good", "Morning")
print(s1new, s2new)
```

## Scope of variables
* When you define the function, you have to know about the *scope* of variables.
* The variables defined *inside* the function cannot be used outside the function.
```python
def hello():
  i = 10
  print(i)
  return

hello()   # => 10
print(i)  # => not defined
```
* This is because `i` in the above funcion is *local variable*.
* Instead, variables defined outside the function is *global variable* so they can be accessed even inside the function.
```python
i = 10
def hello():
    print(i)
    return

hello()
```
* Note that the same variable name is used for both local and global variables, the global variable is used.
```python
a = 10

def hello():
    a = 20
    return

hello()
print(a)
```
* It is safer to use *global* inside the function to access the global variable.
```python
a = 10

def hello():
    global a
    a = 20
    return

hello()
print(a)
```

## Exercise
1. Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
2. Create a function that recieves a list (e.g. [10, 20, 30]), and then returns the new list in which each elements are doubled.
