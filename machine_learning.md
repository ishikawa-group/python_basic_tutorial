# Machine learning
* In this lecture, we' ll learn simple machine learning techniquies and how to do it in python.

Part 1: Introduction to scikit-learn and Data Representation
Lecture 1: Introduction to scikit-learn and Data Handling
Overview of scikit-learn: its purpose, features, and popular algorithms.
Introduction to machine learning concepts: supervised and unsupervised learning.
Installing scikit-learn and understanding the basic data structures.
Code Example:

python
Copy code
# Example: Importing scikit-learn and loading a dataset
from sklearn import datasets

# Load a sample dataset (e.g., Iris dataset)
iris = datasets.load_iris()
print("Features:", iris.feature_names)
print("Target:", iris.target_names)
Part 2: Supervised Learning - Regression and Classification
Lecture 2: Regression with scikit-learn
Understanding regression problems and scikit-learn's regression tools.
Implementing linear regression and evaluating the model's performance.
Code Example:

python
Copy code
# Example: Linear Regression using scikit-learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample data preparation (X, y)
X, y = iris.data[:, :2], iris.target  # Example using Iris dataset features

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
Lecture 3: Classification with scikit-learn
Understanding classification problems and scikit-learn's classification algorithms.
Implementing logistic regression and evaluating classification models.
Code Example:

python
Copy code
# Example: Logistic Regression for Classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Using the Iris dataset (X, y)
X, y = iris.data[:, :2], iris.target

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Logistic regression model
classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
Part 3: Unsupervised Learning and Model Evaluation
Lecture 4: Unsupervised Learning and Model Evaluation
Introduction to unsupervised learning and clustering using scikit-learn.
Evaluating models and assessing their performance.
Code Example:

python
Copy code
# Example: K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Using the Iris dataset (X)
X = iris.data[:, :2]

# K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Visualizing clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=200, c='red', label='Centroids')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
This lecture plan introduces scikit-learn progressively, starting with its fundamentals, moving to supervised learning (regression and classification), and concluding with unsupervised learning and model evaluation. The provided code examples demonstrate essential functionalities and implementations using scikit-learn.
